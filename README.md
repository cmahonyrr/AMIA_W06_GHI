# AMIA 2025 Workshop: Identifying Solutions to Challenges to AI Deployment in Biomedical Informatics

This repository hosts the public website for the AMIA 2025 workshop: **Identifying Solutions to Challenges to AI Deployment in Biomedical Informatics**.

## 🚀 Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `<your-repo>`).  
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo root.  
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set:  
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`)  
   - **Folder:** `/root`  
4. Replace `site_url` placeholders in `index.html` with your real Pages URL: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.  
5. Commit. Your site will be live at your Pages URL.

## ✍️ Edit content

- Update hero text, schedule, speakers, and organizers directly in `index.html`.
- For analytics, you can add your snippet before `</head>` (e.g., Plausible or GA4).

## 🔎 SEO

- Semantic headings and accessible nav.  
- Open Graph/Twitter cards.  
- JSON‑LD Event schema.  
- Mobile‑first design with good Core Web Vitals.

## 🧩 Custom domain

1. Add your domain in **Settings → Pages**.  
2. Create a `CNAME` record pointing to `<username>.github.io`.
